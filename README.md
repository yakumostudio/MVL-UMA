# Enhanced Self-Supervised Multi-View Representations with Modality-Missing Robustness for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition

This repository currently provides checkpoints and inference code for the paper **"Enhanced Self-Supervised Multi-View Representations with Modality-Missing Robustness for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition"**.
We plan to release the pretraining and finetune code after the paper is formally accepted.

## Installation

The environment setup is based on AV-HuBERT. For more details, refer to the [AV-HuBERT](https://github.com/facebookresearch/av_hubert).

## Checkpoints

The model checkpoints are available for download. Use the following link to access the checkpoints:
